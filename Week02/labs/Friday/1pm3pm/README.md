# Lab Week 2: Periodic Table Guessing Game  

In this lab session, we will collaboratively work on the starter `main.py` file. After the lab, you are expected to complete the tasks below.

---

### **Problem Requirements**

1. **Define Elements:**  
   Create an array called `elements` that contains the names of the first 10 elements of the periodic table:  
   `["Hydrogen", "Helium", "Lithium", "Beryllium", "Boron", "Carbon", "Nitrogen", "Oxygen", "Fluorine", "Neon"]`.

2. **Random Element Selection:**  
   - Use a random number generator to select a random element from the `elements` array. Save the selection in a variable called `randomElement`.  
   - Print a message such as: "A random element has been chosen."

3. **Guess the Element:**  
   - Prompt the user to guess the randomly chosen element by typing its name (e.g., "Oxygen").  
   - Compare the user's guess to `randomElement` and determine if it matches.  

4. **Provide Feedback:**  
   - If the user guesses correctly, print: "Correct! The element was {randomElement}."  
   - If the user guesses incorrectly, print: "Wrong! The correct element was {randomElement}."

5. **Optional Challenges:**  
   - If the user's guess is partially correct (e.g., different casing or extra spaces), strip unnecessary spaces and ignore case when comparing.  
   - After revealing the correct answer, print an additional message about the element. For example:  
     - "Hydrogen is the lightest element in the universe."  
     - "Helium is commonly used in balloons."  

6. **Enhance User Interaction:**  
   - Allow the user to guess up to 3 times. If the user still fails after 3 attempts, reveal the correct element and end the program.  
   - After each incorrect guess, print a hint such as: "Try again! The element starts with '{first_letter}'."  

7. **Input Validation:**  
   - Ensure the user's input is a string. If itâ€™s not valid (e.g., an empty input or a number), print an error message and prompt them again.

**Starter Code (main.py):**

```python

# Define the elements array

# Randomly select an element

# Prompt the user to guess (to be completed)

# Compare guess to the random element (to be completed)
```

**Lab Session Goals:**  
- Understand the use of arrays for storing and accessing data.  
- Practice conditionals for comparing user input with predefined values.  
- Work with string manipulation to handle case-insensitive comparisons.  

**Post-Lab Tasks:**  
- Complete the enhancements to the program as described above.  
- Test your program with different inputs to ensure all conditions are met.

This problem introduces core programming concepts like arrays, user input, conditionals, and string manipulation while adding an educational twist about chemistry elements.
