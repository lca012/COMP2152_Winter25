# Lab Week 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors Coding Problem
  

In the lab session, we will code the starter `main.py` together. After the lab, complete the following:

---

### **Problem Requirements**

1. **Define Choices:**  
   Create an array called `choices` that contains the options for the game: `"Rock"`, `"Paper"`, and `"Scissors"`.

2. **Simulate a Game Round:**  
   - Use a random number generator to simulate the player's choice and the computer's choice. Both should be numbers between 0 and 2 (inclusive).  
   - Save the player's choice in a variable called `playerChoice` and the computer's choice in a variable called `computerChoice`.  
   - Use these numbers as indices into the `choices` array to determine the selections. Print out both the player's and computer's choices.

3. **Determine the Winner:**  
   Implement the following rules to determine the winner:  
   - Rock beats Scissors.  
   - Scissors beat Paper.  
   - Paper beats Rock.  
   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.  

   Print one of the following messages based on the outcome:  
   - `"Player wins!"`  
   - `"Computer wins!"`  
   - `"It's a tie!"`

4. **Optional Challenges:**  
   - If the player wins, print: `"You got lucky this time..."`  
   - If the computer wins, print: `"Better luck next time!"`  
   - If it's a tie, print: `"Looks like we're evenly matched."`

5. **Input Validation:**  
   - Ensure all inputs are valid integers. If an invalid input is detected, print an error message and terminate the program.  

6. **Enhance User Interaction:**  
   Modify the program to allow the user to input their choice as a string (e.g., `"Rock"`, `"Paper"`, `"Scissors"`).  
   - Convert the user input to a corresponding index for the `choices` array.  
   - Add error handling for invalid string inputs.

**Starter Code (main.py):**

```python

# Define the choices array

# Simulate choices (randomly for now)

# Print both choices

# Determine the winner (to be completed)
# Add more conditions here for Rock, Paper, Scissors rules
```

---

**Lab Session Goals:**  
- Understand the logic of conditionals and array indexing.  
- Fix logical errors in the starter code.  

**Post-Lab Tasks:**  
- Add the required enhancements described above.

This problem builds upon core programming concepts and includes opportunities to explore user interaction and input validation.
